# Simple IRMA signature verifier

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). See `README-react.md`.

This is a very simple IRMA signature verifier, that uses an IRMA Api server to verify IRMA signatures. This project is *not* production ready and only serves as an example.

## Running it

Edit `const endpoint` in `src/App.js` and let it point to a valid IRMA Api Server.

After it, run it with:

```
   $ yarn       # or: npm install
   $ yarn start # or: npm start
```
